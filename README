if you share scripts and other files you don't intend to.

ChangeLog:
    2009-05-13: Initial Release
    2010-05-12: Added Documentation
                Changed one of the styles to make the numbers a fixed-width font

Known Issues:
    The line numbers are sometimes useless, as they don't align with the code always. If
        this happens, try switching to another color in the list.

TODO:
    Change the way the code is drawn to better align the line numbers.
    Reload Colorschemes with Ajax
    Serve syntax-highlighted files with Ajax by accessing them directly through a page
    Eventually, I'd like to be able to accept settings through Apache to change stylesheets,
        default colorschemes, and more.
    Link to local include files so that projects can be browsed
